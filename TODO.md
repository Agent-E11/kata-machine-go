# Things I need to do

<!-- TODO:-->

- [ ] Check to make sure all APIs are consistent
    - [ ] All Get methods should return (value T, ok bool)
    - [ ] Store single characters as runes, instead of strings (I think)
- [ ] Create a sorttest package that all the sorting tests can use
- [ ] Move all type defintitions to central package (maybe?) (like tree.BinaryNode, and graph.WeightedAdjacencyList)
- [ ] Create simpler testing framework, like jest (maybe?)
